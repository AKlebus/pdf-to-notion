## Disclaimer: Work in progress

This project is for a friend who likes taking notes in notion that have a very specific format. It is very much still a work in progress, as the focus has been put getting them a miminum viable product. Future work planned on this project:

- Proper readme with setup instructions.
- Options for using different image hosting sites.
- Proper handling of API keys (instead of hardcoding).
- Better handling of arguments (e.g. argparse).
- Option of using page titles instead of keys.
- Options to upload to Notion database.
